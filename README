This build system requires the following:
	lfs user and home directory
	Fetch build system from https://www.github.com/baho-utot/BLFS-RPM.git

Notes:
	This system is geared to i686 but you should be able to tickle it
	into building upon x86_64 systems.

	This build system uses su.

	If you don't want to enter the root password on every step then
	you can temporary modify /etc/passwd and remove the x in the
	root user entry.

Procedure for the setting up of the build:
	Login as lfs
	git clone https://github.com/baho-utot/BLFS-RPM.git
						- clone repository
	ln -vfs BLFS-RPM/rpmbuild		- create symlink
	vi /mnt/lfs/rpmbuild/complete.sh	- edit flags/configuration
	pushd rpmbuild/SOURCES			- switch directory
	wget -nc -i wget-list 			- fetch packages
	md5sum -c md5sums			- verify packages for lfs
	popd					- back to parent
	./complete.sh				- build system & install

You should save the *.rpm and *.srpm files for reuse or to
install this build on other computers.
