What exactly are these messages about? I don't recall seeing them before.

dmesg | grep 'used greatest stack depth'

Code:	

[    0.132082] kworker/u16:0 (42) used greatest stack depth: 14040 bytes left
[    1.056243] kworker/u16:5 (1235) used greatest stack depth: 13016 bytes left

You have stack instrumentation turned on in your kernel. These are benign until you hit 0 stack.

It's enabled by CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE in the debug options in your kernel config.
